# NOTE: BuiltInCogs.py is the Built In Cog. Pretty self-explanatory.
"""
BuiltInCogs.py is the Built In Cog, as seen above. It is automatically loaded when you run community_bot.py.
Without it, the bot would be severely crippled, and there would be no functionality.
BuiltInCogs.py is made up of SEVEN different classes, which are:
    - DebugAndEvents. This class contains all the events for the bot, as well as some commands to debug the bot.
    - OwnerOnly. This class can only be used by the server/guild owner. Pretty self-explanatory.
    - FunCommands. This  class is mostly used by P E A S E N T S, which contains several fun commands.
    - MathCommands. This class contains some basic arithmetic operations, and if you want more cmds, import MoreMathCommands.
    - ModeratorCommands. This class contains some very useful commands for the moderators of your discord server.
    - MiscellaneousCommands. This class contains miscellaneous commands. WOW!
    - Tasks. This class has some core tasks, like the audit log updater, as well as some tasks-related functions.

I won't go into details about this, because then it would be way too long, to find out more, go to BuiltInCogs_doc.txt.
made with ♥ (?) with discord.py.
