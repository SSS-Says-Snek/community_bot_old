This is a bot made by a random person who is `13` years old. Yes, you heard me right. THIRTEEN years old.
As a result, it is EXTREMELY bad, and EXTREMELY bad. Do not download it, because it requires
some files that are not on your computer. But that's fine! This is only to admire my work.
(Also, I am not good at HTML or Markdown, so apologies for the sloppy .md file!)

<p>
    Features include:
        <ul>
        THIS .md file
    </ul>
    <ul>
        A <strong>.py</strong> file to actually run the dang thing. (Please don't run.)
    </ul>
    <ul>
    A folder called <strong>cogs</strong> that contains all the cogs needed.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        A <strong>.txt</strong> file containing the changelogs of the bot
    </ul>
    <ul>
        An <strong>.ini</strong> file that contains info about the bot
    </ul>
That's basically it! I will continue working on the bot (hopefully), and add more functionality.
Hopefully, I can change the bot from a test bot into a real bot!
